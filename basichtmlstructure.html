             Basically HTML  helps us upload files by adding tags that can be uploaded on a server  and can be read by an  end user by use of  a browser such as Chrome.
                  BY the use of Hyper Text Transfer Protocol we can view webpages on our devices by just connecting to the internet allowing us share information 
                           which is is processed data hence communicate as human beings.
